Hi! I'm Ethan Tock.

I am 16 years old and a high school sophomore with a passion for STEM.

I'm an intermediate hobby Python developer with many toys and apps under my belt, the more official of which will be published here.
This summer, I would be very eager to have a Python internship to learn lots more about the language I am best at!
