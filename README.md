Hi! I'm Ethan Tock.

I am 17 years old and a high school junior with a passion for STEM.

I'm currently quite adept at Java and Python, and I'm learning how to use object-oriented programming to its fullest.
I'm building an indie game with one of my friends right now, and it's still in its initial stages of development.

This account is a library of all of my favorite programs that I have created. Enjoy exploring it!
